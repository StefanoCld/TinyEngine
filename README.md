## What is it?
This is a basic raycaster, that renders on the system console (no graphics libraries involved). It started during a graphics programming lesson, and was given to us as a template for the final assignment of the course.

Once i finished the task, i decided to refactor the code to a more OOP-oriented structure, in order to:
  - Have an object hierarchy
  - Adding new primitives (Which at the moment are the Disk, and the Triangle (billboard))
  - Customize the lighting function

## How to run it
Just build the solution, and launch the .exe.
